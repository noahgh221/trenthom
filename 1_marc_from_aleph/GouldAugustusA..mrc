Gould writes of his life as tutor to the family of Mr. McBlair, a wealthy manufacturer of Jericho, Maryland, in long, detailed letters to his father, Nathaniel Duren Gould. In the earlier letters, he describes the trip from Boston, the roads and landscape, and presents a pencil drawing of the McBlair house and surrounding buildings. He writes of the day's routine, his teaching duties, and neighborhood news and gossip. He tells of how he listens for the mail wagon and of his disappointment with his pupils. His letters show that he did manage to keep up with events beyond Jericho, especially in the New England area. In his later letters, he professes a growing interest in medicine and botany. A much later letter informs William Jenks of his election as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.12aJenks, William,d1778-1866.2 aHistory of Medicine Collections (Duke University)
