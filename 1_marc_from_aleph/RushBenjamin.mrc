The letter reflects post-revolutionary state politics in Pennsylvania. In the letter, Rush censures his fellow Presbyterians, who refuse to revoke the test laws and to admit amendments to the state constitution. He also condemns the taking over by the Presbyterian dominated state government of the charter of the College of Philadelphia, now the University of Pennsylvania, and refers to the College of Carlisle, or Dickinson College, established in protest to the first action. He regrets the inflammatory remarks and publications made by members of the state's single legislative body, the Council of Censors, and by Joseph Reed and Mr. Smiley, and deplores the character of Henry Osborn and Owen Faris.12aArmstrong, John,d1758-1843.12aBayard, John Bubenheim,d1738-1807.22aUniversity of Pennsylvania22aDickinson College 2aPennsylvania.2 aHistory of Medicine Collections (Duke University)
