May 1862, Dix lists recommendations for promotions in the US Army hospital administration. This bears an autograph note, signed by Abraham Lincoln, forwarding the list for consideration to Secretary of War Stanton. Dix writes in 1880 to a friend concerning her physical health and in an undated note regarding a mentally ill patient. Papers also include a poem, presumably in Dix's hand, on nursing the mentally ill. This is to be found on the same sheet with the printed poem, "Stanzas", written by a patient in the New Jersey State Hospital for the Insane.  aForms part of the Trent Manuscripts Collection.12aLincoln, Abraham,d1809-1865.2 aHistory of Medicine Collections (Duke University)
