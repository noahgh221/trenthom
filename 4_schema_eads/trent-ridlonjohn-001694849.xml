         <abstract label="Abstract">Collection consists of articles, case files, correspondence, photographs, and medical illustrations dating chiefly from the 1890s-1920, relating to Dr. John Ridlon's extensive research and writings on orthopedics. Case files - a large majority of them pediatric - include tubercular infection of the joints, scoliosis and other deformities, spondylitis (spinal arthritis), and limb or joint injuries. There are hundreds of illustrations in the form of photographs mounted on board, photographic prints of X-rays, and printed illustrations on loose sheets that show patients, symptoms or deformities, and treatments such as braces and casts. Accompanying the professional papers is a set of 118 black-and-white photographs taken during Ridlon's service as a surgeon in the U.S. Army Medical Corps during World War I. In the same Photographs Series are several portraits of Ridlon, and a series of photographs of him posed in his office and examination room, taken in 1911. Bound volumes comprise: six casebooks (1889-1892); four letterbooks (1873-1903); an autograph manuscript, "Some comments on the principles and practice of Hugh Owen Thomas" (undated); a scrapbook of figures and illustrations (undated); three volumes composed of reprint clippings and manuscript notes (undated); and a bound volume of 88 reprints (1888-1923). There are also many letters of recommendation, diplomas, and certificates.Correspondents include: R. Osgood, A. Steindler, P. D. Wilson, R. K. Ghormley, J. E. Goldthwait, A. B. Judson, R. W. Lovett, H. W. Orr, S. W. Mitchell, and H. Cushing. In addition to discussing medical cases and research, letters also document Ridlon's involvement with two charitable institutions: the Home for Destitute Crippled Children (Chicago) and the Country Home for Convalescent Children. Acquired as part of the History of Medicine Collections at Duke University. </abstract>
